### *1. Provide link to Github repository*

https://github.com/sammito1/fuel

### *2. Has your design and development methodology changed since assignment 1? Why?*

We are still designing and developing our application using **incremental development**, as it is continues to be the most logical way to implement a small-scale web application as specified. This phase of the application development process involves creating the front-end of the application, which consists of designing and implementing various relatively standalone HTML pages with some CSS to add style and minimal JavaScript to add basic dynamic functionality.

Before implementing our front-end in code, each team member took responsibility for a certain part of the functionality of the site, with one member being responsible for login/registration and the homepage, another being responsible for the fuel quote form functionality, and another being responsible for the fuel quote history and the client profile management. Next, we each designed rough mockups in photoshop for our assigned pages, which can be seen in the `docs/mockups` directory. Once we completed the mockups, we reviewed them as a team and moved on to the next step.

After completion of the mockups, we implemented our designs in HTML/CSS/JS individually as separate web pages and reviewed them as a team. Thus, we used incremental development by building our web pages only *after* we designed the basic layout required of each page. 

### *3. List what front end technologies you are using and why. Who is responsible for doing what in your group?

### *4. Provide screen shots of each page of the front end.*

### *5. List who did what within the group.*
