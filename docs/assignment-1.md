We will answer the questions here:

2. *Discuss what development methodology you will use and why?*  
We have decided to employ **incremental development** for our project development methodology. The project is already split into sequential assignments/phases, and each assignment requires several components that build off of each other, so incremental development fits easily into the overall project layout. In particular, incremental development provides concrete markers of progress with at least some guaranteed functionality at each iteration. Also, because the project is relatively small-scale with pre-established requirements, the downsides of incremental development (poorly defined structure, not ideal for large systems) are essentially mitigated.
